        <div>
        <p>Genshin Impact has become a global phenomenal mobile game since it was released in 2020. In the first half of 2022 alone, the number of global players of Genshin reached 56 million, the total revenue reached 20 billion yuan, and the per capita payment amount of Chinese server also reached 300 yuan.</br>
            With the growth of the Genshin Impact and the willingness and ability of players to pay, I see a very promising market. Combat gameplay is the core gameplay of the game. Since the time-limited challenge is the most difficult gameplay in Genshin, many players will use the way of racing to prove their game strength, and some players will use the bounty to recruit players to take on some difficult challenges. This kind of play gradually evolved into a kind of folk competition activity, namely, the reward race（悬赏竞速）, this kind of activity is organized by the players themselves, including preparation, planning, advertise, execution.</br>
